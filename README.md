## Playing with Kinect
To play the game using the Xbox 360 Kinect it is necessary that the NiTE and OpenNI are properly installed and configured. In addition said object variables containing the class KinectManager should be changed in ALL scenes that contain it (Level_01, Level_02) for the Boolean variable PlayWithKinect to have the true value (these changes will only take effect being made in the Unity inspector).
